## üìô Description
BadWorkBlocker is a feature rich chat filter suitable for huge servers to keep the chat clean from swear words and spam. It's highly configurable for nearly every needs.

## üéÅ Features
The main features of this plugin are:

- **SWEAR FILTER** Block messages containing swear words (specified in the config file)
- **BLOCK SAME MESSAGES** Show a warning to the player if he tries to send the same message twice
- **PREVENT SPAM** Prevent spam by preventing the player to send messages in an interval shorter than specified in the config
- **ANTI CAPS** Filter messages containing too much uppercase letters

## üñ± Usage
All settings can be changed in the `config.yml`-file, there are no commands:

```yaml
# Language of the plugin messages
# Possible options are: en (English), de (German), fr (French), ru (Russian), tr (Turkish)
language: "en"

# List of the blocked words
badwords:
  - "fuck"
  - "shit"
  - "bitch"

# Ignore spaces in messages when checking for swear words / spam
ignorespaces: true

# Minimum time between chat messages in seconds
waitingtime: 2

# Percentage of uppercase chars in a message required to trigger caps checker
uppercasepercentage: 0.75

# Minimum amount of chars in a message required to activate caps checker (to avoid blocking HI, OK, etc.)
minimumchars: 3

# After how many violations against the chat filter, a player should be kicked/banned - set to 0 to disable
# Violations are reset after a server restart
violations:
  kick: 0
  ban: 0
  resetafterkick: true # reset violations after kick (this disables banning if kick-count is lower)
```
## Disclaimer
I have wrote variants of the "N-Word" and other offensive words. I wasn't using them to refer to anyone/anything in an offensive matter nor was I saying that there isn't a use case for it where it isn't offensive. If you feel offended at all then I am sorry, please accept this appology and go on with your day.
